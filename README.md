# Hangman-Game

**Hangman Game Description:**

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters.

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of the hangman diagram. The game is over when: the guessing player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly.

**Hangman Game History:**

"The origins of Hangman are obscure, but it seems to have arisen in Victorian times," says Tony Augarde, author of "The Oxford Guide to Word Games" (Oxford University Press).

The game is mentioned in Alice Bertha Gomme's "Traditional Games" in 1894 under the name "Birds, Beasts and Fishes." The rules are simple; a player writes down the first and last letters of a word for an animal, and the other player guesses the letters in between.

In other sources the game is called "Gallows", "The Game of Hangin'", or "Hanger".

**How to play Hangman Game:**

1. **Start the game.** Use the command `python main.py` to begin the game 

2. **Guess a letter.** Enter a letter as your guess and press Enter. If the letter is correct and exists in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s). If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.

3. **Continue guessing.** Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or make too many incorrect guesses. If you complete the word, you win! If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, you lose.

4. **Game Over.** The game will indicate whether you've won or lost. You can choose to play again by running the command `python main.py` again.

**That's it! Enjoy playing Hangman!**
